# STCproject

For this project I used Django, Python, MySql, HTML, and Bootstrap. 

Python was used for all of the heavier coding such as: for loops, call, functions, and if statements  

The reason I decided to use the Django framework is due to the user authentication packages that come prebuilt. These packages are used and overseen by a large community of developers. One would hope that vulnerabilities would be identified quickly due to the large community behind django. I see this as an added benefit where one could monitor tech news and the django developer community to keep an eye out for any potential vulnerabilities.  

Using django with the other development technologies allowed for a quick deployment of the web app. The framework allows for an easier management of the code by separating processes into different files.( Views, templates, models, urls, ect.)  

HTML was mixed in with Bootstrap to help maintain web page structures and provide a clean and visually appealing user interface. User experience goes a long way and may deter some users from ever using your application again. It provides an efficient way of producing an environment that would lead to a better user experience. 

MySQL was used simply because of prior experience.
